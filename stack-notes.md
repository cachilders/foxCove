#Foxcove uses the following technologies:

##Node/Express
  With a couple handfuls of API calls, the server is the backbone of our system. Routing and streaming maps to the file system are most of what there is to see here.

##Angular (1)
  Directives. Factories. Controllers. All that. This site is one hundred percent Angular on the client side.

##UI-Router
  Sure, it's a thing to say, but with nested viewports and tight routing we're adopters.

##Foundation (6 for Sites)
  While all of our trademark style classes were handwritten by the Foxcove team, the responsive grid is entirely the work of Foundation. Much love.

##MongoDB (Mongoose/MongoLabs)
  MDB is our catch all data solution. We're using it for sitewide user commenting and for caching resource intensive API calls in multiple systems.

##Postgresql (Bookshelf/Heroku)
  Postgres provides our core functionality of federal representative lookup. We're serving ~49k zipcode-district records and ~900 full US rep bios directly from our own architecture.

##D3
  This was a stretch goal. We implemented it in true Angular fashion and are using it to provide sale tax breakdowns in pie chart style.


## None of this would be possible without the following data sources:
